## Assignment Goals:
1. Access the JSON data stored at this [link](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) to conduct an analysis of the data
2. Create a horizontal bar chart that visualizes each subject's top 10 OTU IDs.
3. Create a bubble chart that visualizes all of the OTU IDs in the subject, comparing them by the number present in the subject.
4. Create a metadata table that displays the demographic information of the subject whose data is being visualized.
5. Add the data to the provided dropdown selector on the page, so users can decide which subjects they want to analyze.
6. Ensure that when a user selects a new subject, the graphs and demographic info tables are updated.
